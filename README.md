<ul>

 <li>Up to this point we’ve been looking at only two features at a time. We’ve done this largely so that we can visualize the decision boundary.  With only two features, the decision boundary is a line in the plane defined by the two features.</li>

 <li>The models we’ve looked at so far (Perceptron, Adaline, and Logistic Regression are applicable to any number of features.</li>

 <li>Using the Iris dataset, focus on the species <strong>Iris-virginica </strong>and <strong>Iris-versicolor</strong>. These two classes are not linearly separable when you use only the two features <strong>petal length </strong>and <strong>sepal length</strong>.</li>

 <li>Train the Adaline learning model using the following</li>

 <li>All six cases of using two features at a time.</li>

 <li>All four cases of using three features at a time.</li>

 <li>The one case of using all features at once.</li>

 <li>Do not use Scikit learn for this assignment. You may, if you want, use the sample code that I’ve posted to Blackboard.</li>

 <li>Summarize your results (i.e, what’ s the best accuracy you can obtain for each of the 11 cases you considered) in a table.</li>

 <li>Discuss your findings. Does using more dimensions help when trying to classify the data in this dataset?</li>

 <li>Include all of your analysis and discussion in your .ipynb file and submit the file through Blackboard. The name of your file should be</li>

</ul>

firstname_lastname_AS02.ipynb

<ul>

 <li>Do not clear your results after you last run so that I will be able to see your results without rerunning your file.</li>

</ul>
